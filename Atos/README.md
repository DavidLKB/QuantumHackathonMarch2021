# Welcome to the Atos github space of the March 2021 QuantX Hackathon.

To start your challenge, please follow the instructions on how to connect to the QLM. At the end of the slides, you will find how you can open the notebook located the QLM and start your project. Everything you need should be on the QLM. 

This space will serve as backup in case you cannot connect to the QLM. In this scenario, you should install myQLM (see below) on your laptop and download the notebook corresponding your challenge from this repository. 

## Summary

Our challenges consists solving some specific problems by developing quantum programs in pyAQASM via 'qat', a python library designed by Atos for writing, simulating, optimizing, and executing quantum programs. It will require to either log on an Atos Quantum Learning Machine, an high-performance quantum stack that can simulate up to 41 qubits, or install myQLM, a spin-off freeware of the QLM appliance.

We will provide an access to a QLM to each group that will have to solve the Atos challenges. The two first challenges are however solvable with myQLM in case of the QLM is unreachable. The third will require to log on a QLM and use specific libraries. To access the QLM, you will need an ssh client. On Linux and Mac, one can use the native ssh client. On Windows, we recommend MobaXterm.

## myQLM Installation

It is not mandatory to install myQLM for the challenges if you can access a QLM. You can also test myQLM without installing it at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/myQLM/myqlm-notebooks/master?filepath=overview.ipynb.

The instructions to install myQLM are available at https://myqlm.github.io/myqlm_specific/install.html

In case you want to solve the challenges on your computer, you will only need to install myqlm and you can ignore myqlm-interop. Please be aware that average laptops allows you to simulate only 20 qubits.

## Getting started

Once you have installed myQLM, you can start writing your own programs in jupyter notebooks or in python scripts. You can find all that you need to start coding at in the documentation of myQLM at https://myqlm.github.io and in tutorial notebooks at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/myQLM/myqlm-notebooks/master?filepath=overview.ipynb
